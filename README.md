SKELO is a 'skeleton project' to get up and running quickly with an interactive app, utilising PixiJS (v4) & React & Create-React-App. CRA chosen due it being great as a base react project (imo).

The aim of all this to provide a great base for interactive canvas projects, with functionailty to easily implement multiple scenes, navs, and other useful app structure stuff packaged in a SPA container.

CRA ejected with WebPack modifications.
Components are abractions to PixiJS features
